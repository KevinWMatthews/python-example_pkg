# Example Package

A sample Python package.
Created following the tutorial at [packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

## Setup


### Virtualenv

I've been running this from within an virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
This may be out of fashion, but this is what I know; learn one thing at a time.

Install your system's python3 into the virtual environment.

```
$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

When finished, deactivate the venv using:
```
$ deactivate
```
